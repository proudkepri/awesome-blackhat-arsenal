## 🧠 Reverse Engineering
<details><summary><strong>DaaS: Decompilation as a Service</strong></summary>

![Asia 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202019-green) ![Category: 🧠 Reverse Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🧠%20Reverse%20Engineering-orange) ![Lucas Esposito](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lucas%20Esposito-informational) ![Rodrigo Cetera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rodrigo%20Cetera-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** "Decompilation-as-a-Service" or "DaaS" is a tool designed to change the way of file decompiling. An analyst usually decompiles malware samples one by one using a program with a GUI. That's pretty good when dealing with a few samples, but it becomes really tedious to do with larger amounts. Not to mention if you have to decompile different types of files, with different tools and even different operating systems. Besides, lots of decompilers cannot be integrated with other programs because they do not have proper command line support.

DaaS aims to solve all those problems at the same time. The most external layer of DaaS is docker-compose, so it can run on any OS with Docker support. All the other components run inside Docker so now we can integrate the decompiler with any program on the same computer. In addition, we developed an API to use DaaS from the outside, so you can also connect the decompiler with programs from other computers and use the decompiler remotely. In our particular case at Deloitte Threat Intelligence team, we needed to decompile thousands of samples received from different systems and to be able to distribute processing and dynamically scale our capabilities.

Although the tool's modular architecture allows you to easily create workers for decompiling many different file types, we started with the most challenging problem: decompile .NET executables. To accomplish that, we used Wine on a Docker container to run Windows decompilers flawlessly on a Linux environment. In addition, on Windows some programs create useless or invisible windows in order to work, so we needed to add xvfb (x11 virtual frame buffer; a false x11 environment) to wrap those decompilers and avoid crashes on our pure command line environment. This allows you to install DaaS in any machine without desktop environment and be able to use any decompiler anyway.

You can access the tool's source code at: https://github.com/codexgigassys/daas

<details><summary><strong>ProcJack + Clove: Non-Invasive Code Instrumentation</strong></summary>

![Asia 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202019-green) ![Category: 🧠 Reverse Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🧠%20Reverse%20Engineering-orange) ![Toshihito Kikuchi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Toshihito%20Kikuchi-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Code instrumentation is expensive work, especially when a target application is large and complex, or even impossible if you don't know the build environment or source code.

This technique, non-invasive code instrumentation, leverages two known techniques: Reflective DLL Injection and Microsoft Detours, enabling you to inject arbitrary code at arbitrary places without re-compiling the target application.

The project consists of two parts: DLL injector and Injectee DLL. You can write your own logic(s) to run and interact with the code of the target process in Assembly and/or C++ and embed it into a DLL file, which can be injected into any user-mode process running on Windows x86 or x64. After injected, the Detours' part of the DLL dynamically re-routes the target's code to run your logic.

Linux, ARM, or kernel-mode is not supported. Injection into Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge will be demonstrated.

![Asia 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202019-green) ![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Masafumi Masuya](https://img.shields.io/badge/Masafumi%20Masuya-informational) ![Isao Takaesu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Isao%20Takaesu-informational) ![Toshitsugu Yoneyama](https://img.shields.io/badge/Toshitsugu%20Yoneyama-informational) ![Takeshi Terada](https://img.shields.io/badge/Takeshi%20Terada-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** In GyioThon released at Black Hat Asia 2018 Arsenal, we used Deep Learning to enable us to identify products that traditional penetration test tools could not identify. In the original GyoiThon, as well as in other tools, it has always been necessary for someone to investigate product-specific features and signature generation with continuous updates, which we've been working to update to make easier. GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool using Deep Learning. Deep Learning improves classification accuracy in proportion to the amount of learning data. Therefore GyoiThon will be taking in new learning data every scanning. Since GyoiThon uses various features of software included in HTTP response as learning data, you scan more, the accuracy of software detection improves. For this reason, GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool.

GyoiThon identifies the software installed on web server (OS, Middleware, Framework, CMS, etc...) based on the learning data. After that, GyoiThon executes valid exploits for the identified software. GyoiThon automatically generates reports of scan results. GyoiThon executes the above processing fully automatically.

GyoiThon's major updates:
- Automatically generates the signature to identify various products.
- Can generate signatures necessary for product identification by even users without Deep Learning knowledge using Deep Learning. You no longer have to investigate product-specific features. You no longer need to create a signature, because GyoiThon itself can generate signatures fully automatically.

GyoiThon is the first penetration test tool that made it possible to generate signatures automatically. GyoiThon is evolving as the growing penetration test tool. For further details: https://github.com/gyoisamurai/GyoiThon/blob/master/handout/BHA2018_handout.pdf

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Tencent IoT Hunter is a framework tool created to quickly build the IoT threat intelligence platform, which is more specifically designed to analyze IOT threats. The tool contains all important modules for IOT threat analysis, including information collection, data extraction, threat data analysis, and intelligence visualization. Intelligence data includes, but is not limited to, static information extraction, dynamic operation information extraction, and third-party network platform information. The goal of this tool is to help security researchers quickly and easily build their own IOT intelligence platform for IOT malware research and threat tracking.

Using this framework tool, you can get the malicious information (CNC, Domain, function, etc.) in the IoT sample file very precisely and fine-grained. Compared with the traditional simple string extraction, this extraction method is more accurate and supports the extraction of encrypted information. This malicious information can be directly used to integrate into the IoT malicious information base and threat cloud search services, without the need for analysts to re-confirm, greatly improving the efficiency of malicious information processing.

Traditional intelligence information extraction tools are often used to extract predefined information. The framework provides a good extension interface, where users can write personalized plugins to expand the scope of information extraction. For the emerging threats, security analysts can quickly integrate analysis experience such as decryption algorithm into the framework, accurately extract malicious intelligence, and reduce invalid redundant information.

In the tool demonstration phase, we will demonstrate how to use the entire tool. Including the static information of IOT samples. Take popular IOT threats as examples to show how to precisely extract CNC, weak passwords, and configuration files. We will also show how to develop and integrate the platform plug-ins to extract any specific intelligence information of concern. All of the above data information is imported to the platform, security personnel can be free to carry out data analysis, malware track, threat visualization.

📝 **Description:** VxWorks is the industry's leading real-time operating system. It has been widely used in various industry scenarios, which require real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certifications such as the NASA's Insight Spacecraft. There was lot's of research on Linux based Router and camera, rarely seen research of VxWorks based device.

Most of VxWorks based IoT devices on the market didn't contain any built-in debugger like WDB(VxWorks WDB Debug Agent) or command line debugger. Without debugger it's almost impossible to analyze the root cause of vulnerability or exploit vulnerabilities.

VxHunter contains an firmware analyze tool and an serial debugger tool. The firmware analysis tool is an IDA plugin which can automatically analyze and rebase firmware to correct loading address, fix function name from symbol table, etc. The serial debugger tool is designed for the target which didn't have built-in debugger like WDB. With VxHunter's help, we successfully analyzed and exploited the CVE-2018-19528 vulnerability.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** The broad-brush popularity of Microsoft (MS) Office documents led them to become one of the main cyber-attacking vectors to spread malware via email attachments or web downloads. The first major outbreak of its kind is the notorious macro-based malware "Melissa" during the turn of last century and this century. Since 2014 we started to see rising weaponized Office documents, particularly visual basic application (VBA) macro-based attacks (banking Trojan like "Dridex" or ransomware such as "Locky"). According to a Sophos report in 2017, over 80% of document-based malware were delivered via MS Word or Excel files. Even though these attacks are not new in nature, the increasing volume and complexity of the attacks impose huge challenges to traditional signature-based anti-virus (AV) products.

As a countermeasure, AV companies have spent an enormous amount of effort creating heuristic rules over decades for signature-based detection. To better leverage the rules already used in traditional AV solutions, we propose to combine them statistically using a simple random forest-based machine learning (ML) classifier. In this demonstration, a comprehensive list of over 3000 existing heuristic rules is used to train the ML model. The training data feed comprises around 92600 real-world benign and malicious MS Office documents including Word, Excel and PowerPoint file formats. The testing datasets include 17929 malicious files and 12511 benign files collected recently. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits enhanced performance and significantly outperforms eleven well known commercial anti-virus scanners with a much higher true positive rate (TPR) of 98.46% achieved while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.33%. Of the evaluated commercial AV scanners, the best one achieves only a TPR of 87.5%, which is more than 10% lower than the proposed ML model.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** pytm is a Pythonic framework for threat modeling. Developers can define their system in Python code as a collection of objects and annotate them with properties. Security practitioners can add threats to the "Threats" object (see https://github.com/izar/pytm/blob/master/pytm/threats.py). The logic lives in the "condition" of the "Threats" object, where members of target can be logically evaluated. If the "condition" returns a "True", that means the rule found a potential threat. More details at https://github.com/izar/pytm

Usage:
tm.py [-h] [--debug] [--resolve] [--dfd] [--report] [--all]
[--exclude EXCLUDE] [--seq]

optional arguments:
-h, --help show this help message and exit
--debug print debug messages
--resolve identify threats
--dfd output DFD (default)
--report output report
--all output everything
--exclude EXCLUDE specify threat IDs to be ignored
--seq output sequential diagram
