![Asia 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202017-green) ![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming-red) ![Pedro Cabrera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pedro%20Cabrera-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [CellAnalysis](https://github.com/pcabreracamara)  
📝 **Description:** CellAnalysis is a tool every pentester should add to his/her arsenal. Nowadays there are other tools intended to find fake cells (fake stations, IMSI Catchers, etc.), most of them use active monitoring; that is, they monitor traffic coming to the SIM card on a smartphone, so that only cell attacks are scanned on the same network as the SIM card. CellAnalysis offers a different approach, it performs a passive traffic monitoring, so it doesn't require a SIM card or a mobile device, just an OsmocomBB phone or compatible device SDR (rtlsdr, usrp, hackrf or bladerf) to start monitoring all the frequencies of the GSM spectrum.Far from being an out-of-the-box tool, it has been developed using shell-scripting to make easier the code modification or the customization by the pentester, as well as the integration with other tools. SDR device or OsmocomBB phone connected to the computer running Linux will analyze the spectrum or a part of it, in search of cells and for each cell found, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information transmitted will be carried out. Alarms generation is not based on a scoring system, but each parameter chosen as a potential threat will generate an alarm if it is evaluated as such in the cell under study.

<details><summary><strong>Shadow-Box: Lightweight Hypervisor-Based Kernel Protector</strong></summary>

![Asia 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202017-green) ![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming-red) ![Seunghun Han](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seunghun%20Han-informational) ![Junghwan Kang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Junghwan%20Kang-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Shadow-Box: Lightweight Hypervisor-Based Kernel Protector](https://github.com/YukZhao/SEConfPaperList)  
📝 **Description:** Protection mechanisms running in the kernel-level (Ring 0) cannot completely prevent security threats such as rootkits and kernel exploits because the threats can subvert the protections with the same privileges. This means protections need to be provided with higher privileges. Creating Ring -1 is plausible using VT such as ARM TrustZone, Intel VT-x, and AMD AMD-v. The existing VT (Virtualization Technologies) supports to separate the worlds into a host (normal world, ring -1, host) and a guest (normal world, ring 0 ~ ring 3). Previous research such as NumChecker, Secvisor, NICKLE, Lares, and OSck used VT to protect kernel.In this demo, we show a security monitoring framework for operating systems, Shadow-box, using state-of-the-art virtualization technologies. Shadow-box is introduced at Black Hat Asia 2017 briefing and has a novel architecture inspired by a shadow play. We made Shadow-box from scratch, and it is primarily composed of a lightweight hypervisor and a security monitor. The lightweight hypervisor, Light-box, efficiently isolates an OS inside a guest machine, and projects static and dynamic kernel objects of the guest into the host machine so that our security monitor in the host can investigate the projected images. The security monitor, Shadow-Watcher, places event monitors on static kernel elements and tests security of dynamic kernel elements. We manipulate address translations from the guest physical address to the host physical address in order to exclude unauthorized accesses to the host and the hypervisor spaces. In that way, Shadow-box can properly introspect the guest operating system and mediate all accesses, even when the operating system is compromised.Shadow-box is an open source project (MIT license), and we have been successfully operating Shadow-box in real world since last year. Real world environment is different from laboratory environment. So, we have gone through many trials and errors for a year, and have learned lessons from them. We share our know-hows about using virtualization technology and deploying research into the wild.

🔗 **Link:** [HaboMalHunter: An Automated Malware Analysis Tool for Linux ELF Files](https://github.com/Tencent/HaboMalHunter/blob/master/WhitePaper.md)  
📝 **Description:** HaboMalHunter is an automated malware analysis tool for Linux ELF files, which is a sub-project of Habo Analysis System independently developed by Tencent Antivirus Laboratory. It can comprehensively analyze samples from both static information and dynamic behaviors, trigger and capture behaviors of the samples in the sandbox and output the results in various formats. The generated report reveals significant information about process, file I/O , network and system calls.Recently, HaboMalHunter has opened its source code under the MIT license, aimed to share and discuss the automatic analysis technology with researchers alike. The project applies digital forensics techniques, such as kernel space system call tracing and memory analysis, and it emphasizes the importance of collaboration with mainstream security tools by making it easy to add third-party YARA rules and supporting the output of .mdb files that are hash-based signature of the ClamAV. The tool, by generating a .syscall file containing a system call number sequence, is also friendly to artificial intelligence research on malware classification and detection.HaboMalHunter has also been deployed and validated with a large-scale cluster at Tencent Antivirus Laboratory. With the processing ability of thousands of ELF malware samples per day, most of which are from the VirusTotal, HaboMalHunter helps security analysts extract static and dynamic features effectively and efficiently. We hope to present the technical architecture and the detailed implementation about HaboMalHunter and to demonstrate it with several typical real-world Linux malware samples.DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/Tencent/HaboMalHunter

🔗 **Link:** [Smart Whitelisting Using Locality Sensitive Hashing](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/tlsh/blob/master/R/tlsh-package.R)  
📝 **Description:** Using cryptographic hashes (such as SHA1 or MD5) for whitelisting results in some limitations. Machine Learning extensions of whitelisting may be used for execution control, verification, minimizing false positives from other detection methods or other purpose.Locality Sensitive Hashing is a state of the art method in machine learning for the scalable approximate-nearest-neighbor search.The identification of executable files which are very similar to known legitimate executable files fits very well within this paradigm.ToolsWe provide open source tools for the evaluation of TLSH (a locality sensitive hash) of executable programs.We also provide a backend query service which we will make available to researchers on an ongoing basis.In this talk, we show the effectiveness of applying locality sensitive hashing techniques to identify files similar to legitimate executable files. In the demo we will:Give a brief explanation of locality sensitive hashingDescribe typical modifications made to legitimate executable files (such as security updates, patches, functionality enhancements, and corrupted files)Given a program P, demonstrate how the tool can be used to query for similar executable filesDemonstrate how meta data (such as certificates) can be employed to confirm the legitimacy of program P

<details><summary><strong>MineMeld</strong></summary>

![Asia 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202017-green) ![Category: 🔍 OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔍%20OSINT-lightgrey) ![Luigi Mori](https://img.shields.io/badge/Luigi%20Mori-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [MineMeld](https://github.com/jtschichold)  
📝 **Description:** Using threat intelligence to enforce security policy poses several challenges. Sources of threat indicators often place indicators in multiple formats or format them inconsistently. Using indicators from multiple sources and packaging them into different formats requires a large investment of time and effort, especially as you discover new sources of indicators. It is also difficult to keep track of updates to threat indicator sources, since they are updated at different times and not always on a regular basis. To automate many of these manual processes, we have released MineMeld.MineMeld is an open source Threat Intelligence framework you can use, among other things, to process indicators and automatically enforce policy on your firewall or augment logs in your SIEM. At the core of MineMeld is a flexible and extensible engine where the data flow is described via a graph of nodes exchanging indicators with a protocol inspired by BGP. By changing the nodes and how they are connected, you can easily define any kind of Threat Intelligence processing logic. And if you need support for a new format, a new protocol or a new logic, you can develop & add your own custom node to the graph.

<details><summary><strong>NAD - A Tool for Performing Dynamic Runtime Analysis of Android Functions</strong></summary>

![Asia 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202017-green) ![Category: 📱 Mobile Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20📱%20Mobile%20Security-yellow) ![Han Lee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Han%20Lee-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [NAD - A Tool for Performing Dynamic Runtime Analysis of Android Functions](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks/blob/master/analysis.dynamic.md)  
📝 **Description:** Android application penetration testing goes further than testing the client to server communication. In order to get a holistic view on the risk exposure, a thorough analysis of the application has to be done to understand how the application works. This is also imperative to be able to bypass jailbreak detection, SSL pinning, or figure out how the application is handling encryption (e.g. being able to decrypt certain values).There are several approaches available:The application can be decompiled, modified and recompiled. This approach however may not always work due to errors while decompiling.Patch the application by utilizing method hooks and overriding the original method. In order to identify the correct code and method to patch, the penetration tester has to go through the very time consuming process of figuring out the correct methods.Adding to the frustration, most applications in release mode produce minified and obfuscated code. The above-mentioned problems makes analyzing an Android application a very tedious process, even before the actual analysis of the application has started. Currently there are no tools available for Android that allow for easy method hooking. This is why I started developing NAD, a tool which allows testers to perform on the fly method hooks.This talk aims to demonstrate an Android tool built upon the Xposed framework. This tool is an attempt to be the "Burp suite" for Android application methods. It provides the user with several abilities to ease such frustration and make life easier:Perform trace method callsIntercept all methods of the Android applicationPause the applicationModify the input parameters of the hooked methodModify the return value of the hooked methodMy goal for developing this tool is to save time and provide more insight into compiled Android applications.DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/HanLee/Not-a-debugger

🔗 **Link:** [OWASP Seraphimdroid](https://github.com/OWASP/PageCreator/blob/master/all_leaders.csv)  
📝 **Description:** Indonesia is undoubtedly one of the most attractive markets in Southeast Asia. With a population of over 250 million - the largest in the region and the fourth largest in the world, after China, India, and the US - who wouldn't keep an eye on this market?According to We Are Social's compendium of world digital stats, Indonesia now has 88.1 million active internet users, up 15 percent over the past 12 months. Its mobile market has exploded over the past couple of years. SIM subscriptions in Indonesia stand at 326.3 million, way more than its population. This means each mobile phone user owns an average of two SIM cards. 85 percent of the population own mobile phones, while 43 percent carry smartphones.Mobile apps offer a level of convenience that the world has never known before. From home, the office, on the road and even from the hotel room in another country on vacation - can login to any voicemail at work, check the credit card balance, view the bank balance, buy new clothes, book travel and more. This extreme level of convenience has brought with it an extreme number of security risks as user's credit card details, bank logins, passwords and more are flying between devices and backend databases and systems across the net. Understanding these risks can help many people prepare their app and protect, their data and their users.OWASP Seraphimdroid is a privacy and security protection app for Android devices. It enables users to protect their devices against malicious software (viruses, trojans, worms, etc.), phishing SMS, MMS messages, execution of dangerous USSD codes, theft and loosing. Also, it enables user to protect their privacy and to control the usage of applications and services via various kinds of locks.

<details><summary><strong>OpenSCAP</strong></summary>

![Asia 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Asia%202017-green) ![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Martin Preisler](https://img.shields.io/badge/Martin%20Preisler-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [OpenSCAP](https://github.com/mpreisler)  
📝 **Description:** OpenSCAP is the only free and open source implementation of the NIST SCAP standard. It has two major use cases:Vulnerability assessment - enables users to automatically scan their machines for vulnerabilities using OVAL CVE feeds coming from the operating system vendors - Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE, ... OpenSCAP can load the CVE feed and examine the machine, virtual machine storage image or container. Any missing patches are reported.Security compliance - allows fully automated evaluation and remediation of machines using SCAP security policies. Instead of looking at vulnerabilities in this use-case we are looking for weaknesses in the configuration. A good source for SCAP security policies is the open source SCAP Security Guide project which we will demo with OpenSCAP. Check out the list of available products and profiles by visiting https://static.open-scap.org/One of the main improvements in the latest 1.2 branch is the ability to scan various resources using similar command-line interface. We will cover scanning bare-metal machines, remote machines over ssh, VMs, VM storage images, containers and container images.SCAP Workbench is a GUI front-end for OpenSCAP. It allows users to customize security policies for their organization by selecting/deselecting rules and choosing different values (e.g.: password min length) for evaluation. The result can be saved in a so-called tailoring file. To demonstrate we will make such a customized policy.
