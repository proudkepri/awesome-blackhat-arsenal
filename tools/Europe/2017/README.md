📝 **Description:** Modern web applications are noisy systems that generate enormous amounts of logging information. This information is valuable for debugging and for forensic reasons. Yet, sifting through this information is a daunting task, to say nothing of collecting it in the first case. Many teams have turned to suites like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to ingest and surface this treasure trove of information. It's a valuable resource for Security teams, provided they can surface this information in a timely manner. These were the constraints Etsy worked with in 2014. We needed a solution for generating alerts on top of ELK. This system should have the capability to inject additional context into alerts. There was no available solution at the time, so we built one.We named this open-source framework 411. We designed 411 as a solution for detecting noteworthy security events, but it's a general useful alerting tool. Nor is it just limited to Elasticsearch, as we've built additional modules for pull data from other sources! This presentation assumes you have an ELK stack set up already. We'll show you some recommendations on logs to index in Elasticsearch. Examples will be provided of alerts that you can build off these logs. We'll demo some of the ways 411 can add context to alerts and the ways you can receive these alerts. Whether you're a newbie looking to learn more or a security veteran with an established system, 411 will be a valuable addition your toolkit.

📝 **Description:** Many expensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools are available, but the high cost and effort required to deploy agents to every host can be off-putting to companies. The Automated Collection and Enrichment (ACE) Platform is an open source solution that enables agentless threat hunting in an environment. This tool makes it possible for anyone to begin gathering otherwise difficult to collect host data to hunt for threats in their environment.As consultants performing Compromise Assessments, we rarely have the authority or ability to alter a customer's environment to support assessment operations. Actions like enabling Windows Remote Management (WinRM) can require levels of bureaucracy and take months to accomplish. It is also difficult to answer questions surrounding systems running MacOS and Linux. By removing a few of our assumptions, we created ACE, an ASP.NET Web Application that not only allows the scanning of Windows and MacOS machines, but also provides scan management with features like Credential Management, Scan Tracking, and File Downloading.In addition to running scripts and collecting scan data, ACE provides a robust enrichment and ingestion pipeline. Users can easily create individual enrichments in ACE to integrate their favorite data sources, such as hash lookups, IP reputation, sandboxing. The enrichment details can be integrated with original results to create the finalized data types in one object. With a final enrichment, the robust data set can be sent directly to a waiting SIEM for analysis. We supply an ELK docker image which will automatically ingest data collected by ACE. ACE provides an easy and customizable solution for threat hunters to gather and enrich data before it ever reaches the SIEM, enabling more advanced analysis.

<details><summary><strong>ANWI (All New Wireless IDS) - The Â£5 WIDS</strong></summary>

![Europe 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202017-blue) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Sanket Karpe](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sanket%20Karpe-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost Wi-Fi module (ESP8266) and can be deployed at the physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations that cannot afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at a fraction of the cost.The physical size of the sensors is very small and they can be deployed around the perimeter without drawing attention to themselves. ANWI sensors can detect the most commonly used Wi-Fi attacks including Evil Twin, Jamming using de-authentication frames and send alerts to a central console. The central console can be configured to send email to the administrator upon receiving alerts from any of the configured sensors.ANWI aims to fulfill the need of WIDS which is inexpensive yet can protect against most of the possible attacks. It is easy to setup and deploy and works on "fire and forget principle." Once the sensors have been configured, they can be deployed across the perimeter. The central console keeps monitoring the sensors and in case any of the sensors goes offline an alert is generated as well.In case there is need for physical security alerts along with wireless IDS , Passive InfraRed sensor (PIR) can be used to provide alerts on motion detection at perimeter. ANWI is under active development and new features will be added on regular basis. The current production version includes all the above features.PRESENTATION MATERIALS:https://github.com/SanketKarpe/anwi

<details><summary><strong>DET (Data Exfiltration Toolkit)</strong></summary>

![Europe 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202017-blue) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Paul Amar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paul%20Amar-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [DET (Data Exfiltration Toolkit)](https://github.com/rmusser01/Infosec_Reference/blob/master/Draft/L-SM-TH.md)  
📝 **Description:** DET aims to provide a framework to assist with exfiltrating data using either one or several channels. Social media has become extremely popular in recent attacks such as HammerToss, campaign uncovered by FireEye in July 2015. Several tools are also publicly available allowing you to remotely access computers through "legitimate" services such as Gmail (GCat) or Twitter (Twittor). Often gaining access to a network is just the first step for a targeted attacker. Once inside, the goal is to go after sensitive information and exfiltrate it to servers under their control. To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected. With this in mind, I created the Data Exfiltration Toolkit (DET) to help both penetration testers testing deployed security devices and those admins who've installed and configured them, to ensure they are working as expected and detecting when sensitive data is leaving the network.

<details><summary><strong>ID2T - The Intrusion Detection Dataset Generation Toolkit</strong></summary>

![Europe 2017](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202017-blue) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Emmanouil%20Vasilomanolakis-informational) ![Carlos Garcia Cordero](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carlos%20Garcia%20Cordero-informational) ![Max MÃ¼hlhÃ¤user](https://img.shields.io/badge/Max%20MÃ¼hlhÃ¤user-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** There is a never-ending arms race between attackers and defenders in the cyber-security world. Our tool, ID2T, tries to leverage the balance of power towards the defenders' side. ID2T enables security researchers and practitioners to test their defensive tools against synthetic attacks without risks. By injecting synthetic, yet realistic, attacks into network traces, detection mechanisms can be audited, tested and evaluated.ID2T emerges from the gaps that exist between the arsenals of attackers and defenders. Attackers have the upper hand with 0-day exploits and the malware that utilizes them. Ransomware, for example, makes the headlines more often than ever. The development of modern security mechanisms, on the contrary, is moving slowly. One of the reasons for the slow pace is that there are no clear strategies to evaluate novel defensive proposals. Researchers and security practitioners are forced to use archaic and unrealistic network traces to evaluate their proposals. The DARPA 1999 intrusion detection dataset is such an example. It contains 18-year-old network traces (with no resemblance to modern networks) and old attacks.ID2T stands for "Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit". It is an open source toolkit designed to inject synthetic, yet highly realistic attacks, into network traces with the PCAP format. ID2T provides a wide range of modern cyber-attacks for injection; from malware and web application attacks (e.g., against Joomla) to SQL injection and DDoS attacks. Injected attacks are made as realistic as possible by replicating the network conditions and characteristics of any inputted network trace. In this demo session we present the first public release of ID2T, which builds on top of our theoretical work [1].[1]: Vasilomanolakis et al., 2016, April. Towards the creation of synthetic, yet realistic, intrusion detection datasets. In NOMS, 2016 IEEE/IFIP (pp. 1209-1214).

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** LogFeeder enables the injection of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) application logs from Google Apps, Duo, Salesforce, Workday and many more into an ELK (Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana) cluster for monitoring and alerting. It is also possible to get the logs through AWS SQS Queue integration, which allows more flexibility to manipulate where the logs eventually end up. The automated approach saves security teams a lot of time by collating all the information vis-a-vis individually combing through separate data sources for each service. In addition to this, LogFeeder makes it possible to utilize awesome alerting tools, like ElastAlert (presented at Black Hat USA Arsenal in 2015), for robust alerting in response to suspicious actions. At Yelp, we use LogFeeder as a tool to ingest most of our 3rd party service providers' audit logs into a central SIEM (Security Information and Event Monitoring) system. Paired up with ElastAlert, it is the core of our monitoring and alerting pipeline.

🔗 **Link:** [2FAssassin](https://github.com/dothanthitiendiettiende/2FAssassin)  
📝 **Description:** There are many ways to steal someone's private keys without performing social engineering attacks. This talk is dedicated to discussing and demonstrating the newly discovered techniques to bypass the two-factor authentication by stealing and cracking OTP, private keys, and client certificates. By that means, an attacker must compromise the voice or text message accounts, software token, infecting memory agents, cracking passphrase, stealing hardware token, etc. 2FAssassin could turn these looted keys for more fun and profits. The demonstration will include the scenario where the private keys are compromised and then show how an attacker could leverage the situation to gain more access into the corporate networks, as well as making profits. These are not limited to systems that used single sign-on (with 2FA enabled), public key authentication (e.g., password-less authentication, authorized_keys abuse), free software token (e.g., Google Authenticator), website owner (e.g., phishing sites created using stolen private key), and even software vendors (e.g., stolen private key can be used to sign the malicious malware). 2FAssassin will automate the exploitations against the common vulnerabilities that lead to the private key leakage. It can be used to compromise individual system, or the entire network using looted private keys. It also capable to analyze and identify potential private keys from a pool of gathered files, critical key information extraction in order to identify and validate the target domain, cracking and removing the passphrase, injecting arbitrary key-based backdoors to all accessible machines, building multi-chained covert tunnels by leveraging on the loopholes found in vulnerable public key authentication, sign the malware with looted private key followed by automatic bulk distribution, generate phishing site, ... etc, and many many more exciting functionalities.

📝 **Description:** Nowadays, cloud infrastructure is pretty much the de-facto service used by large/small companies. Most of the major organizations have entirely moved to cloud. With more and more companies moving to cloud, the security of cloud becomes a major concern.While AWS provides you protection with traditional security methodologies and has a neat structure for authorization/configuration, its security is as robust as the person in charge of creating/assigning these configuration policies. As we all know, human error is inevitable and any such human mistake could lead to catastrophic damage to the environment.Few vulnerable scenarios:Your security groups, password policy or IAM policies are not configured properlyS3 buckets are world-readableWeb servers supporting vulnerable ssl ciphersPorts exposed to public with vulnerable services running on themIf root credentials are usedLogging or MFA is disabledAnd many more such scenarios...Knowing all this, audit of AWS infrastructure becomes a hectic task! There are few open source tools that help AWS auditing, but none of them have an exhaustive checklist. Also, collecting, setting up all the tools, and looking at different result sets is a painful task. Moreover, while maintaining big infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a major task as well. CS Suite is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS infrastructure and does OS audits as well. CS Suite leverages current open-source tools capabilities and has other missing checks added into one tool to rule them all.

🔗 **Link:** [OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guide](https://github.com/redhatrises/scap-security-guide)  
📝 **Description:** OpenSCAP is the only free and open source implementation of the NIST SCAP standard. It has two major use cases:Vulnerability assessment - enables users to automatically scan their machines for vulnerabilities using OVAL CVE feeds coming from the operating system vendors - Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE, ... OpenSCAP can load the CVE feed and examine the machine, virtual machine storage image or container. Any missing patches are reported.Security compliance - allows fully automated evaluation and remediation of machines using SCAP security policies. Instead of looking at vulnerabilities in this use-case we are looking for weaknesses in the configuration. A good source for SCAP security policies is the open source SCAP Security Guide project which we will demo with OpenSCAP. Check out the list of available products and profiles by visiting https://static.open-scap.org/Recently we have added new Ansible remediation capabilities to both OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guide. Now it's possible to generate Ansible playbooks out of SCAP Security Guide profiles for all products. Furthermore we have improved container scanning and now support compliance profiles as well as CVE scans.

📝 **Description:** Although there are many readily available tools supporting Threat Intelligence for enterprise IT security, the lack of Threat Intelligence tools with a focus on Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a known gap in the security community. To address this shortcoming, we introduce "Threat Miner SDL," a tool leveraging machine learning to automate mining publicly available threat intelligence sources such as security blogs, twitter feeds, NVD (National Vulnerabilities Database) and threat feeds to deliver product specific potential threat information while continuously monitoring for disclosures of relevant potential vulnerabilities during product development and beyond deployment. Threat Miner SDL also provides an integrated threat management console to enable tracking triage and disposition of potential threats.

🔗 **Link:** [CyBot - Open-Source Threat Intelligence Chat Bot (Revamped)](https://github.com/rawalkhirodkar/chatbot/blob/master/aiml/standard/atomic.aiml)  
📝 **Description:** Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using an completely free and open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the home user to the largest security operations center.We were thrilled to demo the end result of our research at Black Hat Arsenal Vegas - a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot. We received great feedback and ideas from an enthusiastic crowd and will demo now demo CyBot revamped at Black Hat Europe. Best of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help write plugins and share them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses. Come make your own threat intelligence bot today!

🔗 **Link:** [Expliot - Internet Of Things Security Testing and Exploitation Framework](https://github.com/kzwkt/iot-exploit)  
📝 **Description:** IoT is an emerging field exploding with new products and innovation. The security of IoT products is still lagging behind for various reasons. One of the important reasons from security researcher's perspective is the availability of security tools. If you have been pentesting IoT products, you would agree that there are too many different tools required for the job and there is no single silver bullet. And when it comes to Smart Infrastructure, we do not have any existing solutions similar to IT penetration testing tools.We started looking at the learning curve and tools required for IoT security research and decided to create a framework that will enable the research community to speed up their research and pentesting effort. Meet expliot (pronounced - explaayotee) an open source IoT security testing and exploitation framework, right now in Beta phase, it will provide the building block for writing exploits and other IoT security assessment test cases with ease by making it simple for security researchers to create and execute simple to complex mis-use cases using the framework. The objective of the framework is:Simplicity - Ease of useExtendability - Easy to extendCoverage - Cover most of the IoT attack surfaceExpliot currently has a few recon test cases to aid pentesting. The aim of the project is to have a single framework provide multiple functionality including interfaces for IoT protocols like coAP, MQTT etc, radio protocols like BLE, Zigbee etc, hardware protocols like JTAG, I2C, SPI etc, firmware analysis.

📝 **Description:** Data exfiltration from a compromised device is usually achieved over the network, via hardware implant, or by manipulating the characteristics of an internal electronic component. Optical covert channels transmit data by modulating visible light in a way that is undetectable to the human eye. Even though hackers and academics have been exploring methods of optical data exfiltration for years, details on the techniques used to capture transmissions are not fully documented and/or require expensive equipment.OpticSpy consists of two open source hardware modules that provide a low-cost way to explore, evaluate, and experiment with optical covert channels. One is based on an easy-to-build digital receiver, while the other is an analog design that allows fine-tuning for a particular target signal.PRESENTATION MATERIALS:http://www.grandideastudio.com/optical-covert-channels/

📝 **Description:** Most companies, small or big, use SAP technologies to work. Many of them provide access to their SAP environments through Citrix. Indeed, supplier or subcontractors need to reach SAP environment, from back office to boardroom, warehouse to storefront, desktop to mobile device; users can quickly and 'securely' access SAP enterprise application software with Citrix virtualization without exposing their SAP landscape to Internet.To pentest SAP system required some knowledge of this technologies and some hacking tool. Unfortunately, lots of SAP hacking tools are not maintained anymore and dependencies are required like RFC SDK to work. When it comes to assess/pentest the security of SAP landscape from Citrix, no tool is freely available and it is not allow or possible to install third softwares or dependencies.We present a compilation of powershell script to assess SAP, which try to answer to this problematic of dependencies and use from Citrix environment. The presentation will start by describing the issues around SAP hacking tools, then we will continue by explaining the restrictions meet to pentest from Citrix system. And then we will present in detail the tool developed to solve the issues meet and of course with some demos.
