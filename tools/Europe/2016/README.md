![Europe 2016](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202016-blue) ![Category: 📱 Mobile Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20📱%20Mobile%20Security-yellow) ![Nishant Das Patnaik](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nishant%20Das%20Patnaik-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** AppMon is a runtime security testing & profiling framework for macOS, iOS and android apps. It is useful for mobile app penetration testers to validate the security issues report by a source code scanner by validating them by inspecting the API calls at runtime. You may use it for monitoring the app's overall activity during its runtime and focus on things that seem suspicious e.g. information leaks, insecure storage of credentials/secret tokens etc. or insecure implementation of crypto operations or just sniff app's network activity from HTTP to Bluetooth. You may either use one or many of the pre-written user-scripts or quickly learn to write your own scripts modify the app's functionality/logic in the runtime e.g. spoofing the DeviceID, spoofing the GPS co-ordinates, bypassing Apple's TouchID, bypassing root detection etc.We shall demo the features of existing 4 core components: Sniffer, Intruder, Android Tracer & IPA Installer. If there any any additional development to the project we shall include its demo as well.

🔗 **Link:** [APT2 - Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/toolswatch/blackhat-arsenal-tools/blob/master/vulnerability_assessment/apt2.md)  
📝 **Description:** Nearly every penetration test begins the same way; run a NMAP scan, review the results, choose interesting services to enumerate and attack, and perform post-exploitation activities. What was once a fairly time consuming manual process, is now automated! Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit (APT2) is an extendable modular framework designed to automate common tasks performed during penetration testing. APT2 can chain data gathered from different modules together to build dynamic attack paths. Starting with a NMAP scan of the target environment, discovered ports and services become triggers for the various modules which in turn can fire additional triggers. Have FTP, Telnet, or SSH? APT2 will attempt common authentication. Have SMB? APT2 determines what OS and looks for shares and other information. Modules include everything from enumeration, scanning, brute forcing, and even integration with Metasploit. Come check out how APT2 will save you time on every engagement.

<details><summary><strong>CROZONO Framework: Leveraging Autonomous Devices as an Attack Vector on Industrial Networks</strong></summary>

![Europe 2016](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202016-blue) ![Category: 🔴 Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔴%20Red%20Teaming-red) ![Sheila Ayelen Berta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sheila%20Ayelen%20Berta-informational) ![Nicolas Villanueva](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nicolas%20Villanueva-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** CROZONO is a framework that allows performing automated penetration tests from autonomous devices (drones, robots, etc.) that could ease the access to the logical infrastructure of an industrial facility, evading physical barriers. The CROZONO framework is presented in two versions: "CROZONO Explorer" and "CROZONO Attacker."At first, it is advisable to use CROZONO Explorer, as it allows the user to perform information gathering about possible attack vectors on the whole industrial facility's perimeter or any other sector. The information gathered by CROZONO Explorer allows the user to see the location of WiFi Access Points and IP Cameras, together with their security levels. The purpose of this step is to find the easiest way to compromise the industrial facility's security. For example, attacking those WiFi access points which have the lowest security level, if any security measures at all.CROZONO Attacker is a smart framework, it has the capability of performing automated attacks targeted to a network, and to take decisions -without the need of the attacker's intervention- on which attacks to perform based on pre-established parameters and the information gathered about its target. The goal of CROZONO Attacker is to breach the network attacking a WiFi access point and then opening a reverse connection to the attacker via the victim's internet connection. Once performed, CROZONO Attacker allows - through its "LAN discovery" and "LAN Attacks" modules - to discover other devices in the target network and launch several attacks on it.One of the best exclusive features of CROZONO is the report generation about all information gathered. In few minutes, it is possible to explore a zone or an industrial facility's perimeter and know its weak points from the summarization of data captured visually, allowing to see its security exposure levels.

📝 **Description:** OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script. This software can be run on Windows/Linux/OSX under python. According to other shellcode generators same as metasploit tools and etc, OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect. OWASP ZSC encoderes are able to generate shell codes with random encodes and that allows you to generate thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with same job in just a second,that means, you will not get a same code if you use random encodes with same commands, And that make OWASP ZSC one of the best! During the Google Summer of Code we are working on to generate Windows Shellcode and new obfuscation methods. We are working on the next version that will allow you to generate OSX.

🔗 **Link:** [WarBerryPi](https://github.com/toolswatch/blackhat-arsenal-tools/blob/master/red_team/warberrypi.md)  
📝 **Description:** What if the only requirements for taking down a corporate network are 60 minutes and $35? Traditional hacking techniques and corporate espionage have evolved. Advanced attacks nowadays include a combination of social engineering, physical security penetration and logical security hacking. It is our job as security professionals to think outside the box and think about the different ways that hackers might use to infiltrate corporate networks.The WarBerry is a customized RaspBerryPi hacking dropbox which is used in Red Teaming engagements with the sole purpose of performing reconnaissance and mapping of an internal network and providing access to the remote hacking team while remaining covert and bypassing security mechanisms. The outcome of these red teaming exercises is the demonstration that if a low cost microcomputer loaded with python code can bypass security access controls and enumerate and gather such a significant amount of information about the infrastructure network which is located at, then what dedicated hackers with a large capital can do is beyond conception. The talk will be comprised of slides and a demonstration of the WarBerry's capabilities in a virtual network.

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** As application, network, and product complexity grow, so do the attack surface and likelihood of vulnerabilities. Highly-skilled pen testers do not scale exponentially, and findings don't make it into secure coding practices or DevOps overnight.How can we enable pen testers to focus on what matters: adversary-oriented penetration testing to detect the most difficult vulnerabilities and exploits? What correlations exist between successful exploits and underlying application or network characteristics? And how can we ensure findings actually make it back into the development lifecycle in a meaningful way?Our research, and Python-based VAPT framework seeks to address these questions, and automates certain tasks to assist pen testers:For each application or network update, network reconnaissance and application/network vulnerability assessments are performed using NMap, Nessus, OpenVAS, and W3AFIdentified vulnerabilities, and their CVEs, are used for retrieving relevant exploits from ExploitDBPenetration tests are performed using W3AF and MetasploitResults obtained at each stage are stored and correlated as part of a (Neo4j-based) knowledge graph, which can be maintained across several (application) releases and tool runs. This allows for:Pen Testers to easily visualize vulnerabilities discovered, and successful/failed exploits - in order to rapidly gain context of additional potential exploits that may be run or vulnerabilities that may be discoverable through sophisticated, manual techniquesDevelopers to visualize vulnerabilities that are persistent across multiple parts of their product/application, and/or across multiple successive releasesWe will demo this initial version at Arsenal, however the extensible nature of our framework allows for integration of additional vulnerability assessment & penetration testing tools or (pre-deployment) code security review tools and their findings as well.

🔗 **Link:** [OWASP CSRFGuard](https://github.com/aramrami/OWASP-CSRFGuard)  
📝 **Description:** OWASP CSRFGuard implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks. In order to implement this pattern, CSRFGuard must offer the capability to place the CSRF prevention token within the HTML produced by the protected web application. CSRFGuard 3 provides developers more fine grain control over the injection of the token. Developers can inject the token in their HTML using either dynamic JavaScript DOM manipulation or a JSP tag library. CSRFGuard no longer intercepts and modifies the HttpServletResponse object as was done in previous releases. The currently available token injection strategies are designed to make the integration of CSRFGuard more feasible and scalable within current enterprise web applications. Developers are encouraged to make use of both the JavaScript DOM Manipulation and the JSP tag library strategies for a complete token injection strategy.CSRFGuard WikiPage: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CSRFGuard_Project

🔗 **Link:** [Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT)](https://github.com/adi0x90/attifyos)  
📝 **Description:** There exists a number of tools in today's security industry which offers static and dynamic analysis of software binaries and mobile applications. However, there is no such toolkit, which helps an embedded or IoT security researcher to analyse firmwares in an in-depth level. FAT or Firmware Analysis Toolkit is a scriptable toolkit suite is a part of Attify's internal pentesting suite which has helped us reduce a significant number of man hours put into firmware analysis in our IoT and smart devices pentest engagements. It comes with an easy to use API which can then be used in additional analysis, as well as for research purposes. It is a toolkit suite which performs static and dynamic analysis of firmwares, also enabling the user to emulate the firmware and having a live firmware device as if a real physical device was sitting on the network. This has been done by taking advantage of Qemu emulation and static vulnerability identification techniques. Below are some of the capabilities of the toolkit : Full emulation of the firmware along with networking Dynamic traffic analysis Static vulnerability identification Integration with tools such as nmap and metasploit for additional assessment and exploitationBy Black Hat EU, there might be more features added to the list which I will later on send once they are in a more concrete stage. FAT has been made possible because of the following open source tools listed below, which FAT leverages at various stages:Binwalk Firmware Modification KitFirmadyneMITMProxyNmapMetasploitSnmpwalkRadare2
