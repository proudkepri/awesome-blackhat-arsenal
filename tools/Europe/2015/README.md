🔗 **Link:** [Android Device Testing Framework v.13](https://github.com/erlang-punch/awesome-erlang?search=1)  
📝 **Description:** The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") project started back in 2014 as a collection of scripts and utilities that aimed to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the vulnerabilities on this mobile device?"  Since then, dtf has grown into a robust and extensive data collection and analysis framework with over 30 modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device, process this information into databases, and then start searching for vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges).  These modules help you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications, frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as binaries, libraries, and device drivers.  In addition, you'll be able to analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find vulnerabilities.

<details><summary><strong>Commix: Detecting And Exploiting Command Injection Flaws</strong></summary>

![Europe 2015](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202015-blue) ![Category: 🌐 Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🌐%20Web/AppSec-blue) ![Anastasios Stasinopoulos](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anastasios%20Stasinopoulos-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Commix: Detecting And Exploiting Command Injection Flaws](https://github.com/commixproject/commix)  
📝 **Description:** Command injections are prevalent to any application independently of its operating system that hosts the application or the programming language that the application itself is developed.The impact of command injection attacks ranges from loss of data confidentiality and integrity to unauthorized remote access to the system that hosts the vulnerable application. A prime example of a real, infamous command injection vulnerability that clearly depicts the threats of this type of code injection was the recently discovered Shellshock bug.Despite the prevalence and the high impact of the command injection attacks, little attention has been given by the research community to this type of code injection. In particular, we have observed that although there are many software tools to detect and exploit other types of code injections such as SQL injections or Cross Site Scripting, to the best of our knowledge there is no dedicated and specialized software application that detects and exploits automatically command injection attacks. This paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing an open source tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting command injection flaws on web applications, named as commix, (COMMand Injection  eXploitation).This tool supports a plethora of functionalities, in order to cover several exploitation scenarios. Moreover, Commix is capable ofdetecting, with high success rate, whether a web application is vulnerable to command injection attacks. Finally, during the evaluation of the tool we have detected several 0-day vulnerabilities in applications.Overall, the contributions of this work are: a) We provide a comprehensive analysis and categorization of command injection attacks; b) We present and analyze our open source tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting command injection vulnerabilities; c) We will reveal(during presentation) several 0-day command injection vulnerabilities that Commix detected on various web based applications from home services (embedded devices) to web servers.

🔗 **Link:** [Credmap: The Credential Mapper](https://github.com/lightos)  
📝 **Description:** It is not uncommon for people who are not experts in security to reuse credentials on different websites; even security savvy people reuse credentials all the time. For this reason "credmap: the Credential Mapper" was created, to bring awareness to the dangers of credential reuse. Credmap takes a user and password as input and it attempts to login on a variety of known websites to test if the user has reused credentials on any of these. New websites can be easily added with simple knowledge of Python.Credmap is also capable of searching in public credential dumps of compromised websites (e.g. r0ckyou, AM, Adobe, etc.) and collecting the user's password from there to then test with on other websites. Credmap was written purely in Python and is open-source and available on GitHub.

## 🔵 Blue Team & Detection
<details><summary><strong>Haka - An Open Source Security Oriented Language</strong></summary>

![Europe 2015](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202015-blue) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Mehdi Talbi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mehdi%20Talbi-informational)

🔗 **Link:** Not Available  
📝 **Description:** Haka is an open source security oriented language that allows to specify and apply security policies on live captured traffic. Haka is based on Lua. It is a simple, lightweight (~200 kB) and fast (a JiT compiler is available) scripting language.The scope of Haka is twofold. First of all, Haka enables the specification of security rules to filter unwanted streams and report malicious activities. Haka provides a simple API for advanced packet and stream manipulation. One can drop, create and inject packets. Haka supports also on-the-fly packet modification. This is one of the main features of Haka since all complex tasks such as resizing packets, setting correctly sequence numbers are done transparently to the user. This enables to specify and deploy complex mitigation scenarios.Secondly, Haka is endowed with a grammar allowing to specify protocols and their underlying state machine. Haka supports both type of protocols : binary-based protocols (e.g. dns) and text-based protocols (e.g. http). The specification covers packet-based protocols such as ip as well as stream-based protocols like http. Thanks to that grammar, we were able to specify several protocols including ip, icmp, tcp, udp, http, dns, smtp and ssl.Haka is embedded into a modular framework including multiple packet capture modules (pcap, nfqueue), logging and alerting modules (syslog, elasticsearch), and auxiliary modules such as a pattern matching engine and an instruction disassembler module. The latter allow to write fine-grained security rules to detect obfuscated malware for instance. Haka was designed in a modular fashion enabling users to extend it with additional modules.Haka is intended to be used by all security communities: network security officer wishing to deploy quickly new security controls, academics wishing to evaluate the detection efficiency of a new algorithm, or security experts trying to investigate an incident on a specific protocol such as a scada protocol.

<details><summary><strong>VolatilityBot</strong></summary>

![Europe 2015](https://img.shields.io/badge/Europe%202015-blue) ![Category: 🔵 Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🔵%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Martin Korman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Martin%20Korman-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [VolatilityBot](https://github.com/mkorman90)  
📝 **Description:** The Volatility Bot-Excavator: effective automation for executable file extraction. Made by and for security researchers.Part of the work security researchers have to go through when they have to study new malware or wish to analyse suspicious executables, is to extract the binary file and all the different satellite injections and strings decrypted during the malware's execution. This initial process is mostly manual, which can make it long and incomprehensive.Enter the Volatility Bot-Excavator. This is a tool developed by and for malware researchers, leveraging the Volatility Framework. This new automation tool cuts out all the guesswork and manual extraction from the binary extraction phase. Not only does it automatically extract the executable (exe), but it also fetches all new processes created in memory, code injections, strings, IP addresses and so on.Beyond the obvious value of having a complete extraction automated and produced in under one minute, the Bot-Excavator is highly effective against a large variety of malware codes and their respective load techniques. It can take on complex malware including banking trojans such as ZeuS, Cridex, and Dyre, just as easily as it extracts from simpler downloaders of the like of Upatre, Pony or even from targeted malware like Havex.After the Bot-Excavator finishes the extraction, it can further automate repair or prepare the extracted elements for the next step in analysis. For example, it can the Portable Executable (PE) header, prepare for static analysis via tools like IDA, go to a YARA scan, etc.
