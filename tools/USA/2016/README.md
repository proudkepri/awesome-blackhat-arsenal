<details><summary><strong>V3SPA: A Tool for Visually Analyzing and Diffing SELinux Security Policies</strong></summary>

🔗 **Link:** [V3SPA: A Tool for Visually Analyzing and Diffing SELinux Security Policies](https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/28c73da6cbf5e76e137a9100ab45697f)  
📝 **Description:** SELinux policies have enormous potential to enforce granular security requirements, but the size and complexity of SELinux security policies makes them challenging for security engineers and analysts to determine whether the implemented policy meets an organization's security requirements. Furthermore, as system complexity increases, so does the difficulty in assessing differential system modifications without requiring a ground up re-verification. Presently, policy analysts and developers primarily use text-based tools such as sediff, grep, and vi to develop and analyze policies. This can be challenging, however, because policies are often composed of tens or hundreds of thousands of rules, which can be difficult to sift through in text-based tools. Some GUI tools exist, such as apol, but these tools do not incorporate visualizations, which can represent dense information compactly and speed up analysis by offloading cognitive processes to the human visual system. In addition, the GUI tools do not support important tasks such as diffing two versions of a policy.To address the challenges in developing and maintaining SELinux security policies, we developed V3SPA (Verification, Validation and Visualization of Security Policy Abstractions). V3SPA creates an abstraction of the underlying security policy using the Lobster domain-specific language, and then tightly integrates exploratory controls and filters with visualizations of the policy to rapidly analyze the policy rules. V3SPA includes several novel analysis modes that change the way policy authors and auditors build and analyze SELinux policies. These modes include:1. A mode for differential policy analysis. This plugin shows analysts a visual diff of two versions of a security policy, allowing analysts to clearly see changes made. Using dynamic query filters, analysts can quickly answer questions such as, "What are the changes that affect passwd_t?"2. A mode for analyzing information flow, identifying unexpected sets of permissions, and examining the overall design of the policy. This plugin allows users to see the entire policy at once, filter down to see only the components of interest, and execute reachability queries both from and to specified domains.As part of our demonstration at Black Hat Arsenal, we will introduce attendees to V3SPA, which we will make freely available online. During our demonstration we will give detailed explanations of V3SPA's algorithms and visualizations, and we will show how V3SPA can be used to assess whether a policy configuration correctly maps to security goals.

<details><summary><strong>A Black Path Toward The Sun</strong></summary>

![USA 2016](https://img.shields.io/badge/USA%202016-black) ![Category: 🌐 Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🌐%20Web/AppSec-blue) ![Ben Lincoln](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ben%20Lincoln-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [A Black Path Toward The Sun](https://github.com/nccgroup/ABPTTS)  
📝 **Description:** Web application servers and appliances are often one of the most highly-visible entry points into an organization or high-security network. If the server is misconfigured or hosting vulnerable code, existing tools can frequently be used by attackers to convert it into a gateway to the internal network. However, taking full advantage of such a system typically requires a network-level connection between the attacker and the web application server. For example, an internet-facing Linux web application server may have network-level connectivity to an internal Windows domain controller, but appropriate client tools may not function correctly when used via a web shell or similar interface. An interactive session (SSH, RDP, et cetera) on the vulnerable system, or port-forwarding to allow direct connectivity to internal services from the attacker's system becomes necessary. If the organization responsible for the server has done everything else correctly (including blocking tunneling via ICMP/DNS), then there may be no additional network-level connectivity possible in either direction between the attacker and the web application server. This closes off SSH, RDP, and similar interactive remote access, and prevents the use of port-forwarding agents such as Meterpreter.This presentation provides a solution to this problem - A Black Path Toward The Sun, a tool (released as open source in conjunction with the presentation) which tunnels TCP traffic through the web application server using the server's existing HTTP/HTTPS interface. That is, a JSP/WAR/ASPX file is deployed on the server (just as a web shell would be), and a Python script is executed on the attacker's system which performs TCP port-forwarding through that deployed server-side component. The tool also incorporates novel measures to make the network communication challenging to detect using traditional IDS/IPS/WAF-type systems. Java/JSP and ASP.NET editions of the server-side component will be included in the initial open source release, but porting the component to other web application servers should be straightforward.

<details><summary><strong>Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)</strong></summary>

![USA 2016](https://img.shields.io/badge/USA%202016-black) ![Category: 🌐 Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20🌐%20Web/AppSec-blue) ![Christian Frichot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Christian%20Frichot-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/References)  
📝 **Description:** The little browser hacking framework that could; BeEF (Once again voted in the top 5 security tools on ToolsWatch.org) is back again for another hands on JavaScript-filled arsenal session of insanity. If you've seen people talk about BeEF, and haven't gotten around to getting your hands dirty, then now is the perfect time to look under the cover and see how hook.js works. While the framework itself is hanging together with duct tape, Ruby and JavaScript, the capabilities of BeEF have been slowly marching forward year by year, with new features being added almost as quickly as new HTML5 APIs are added to browsers. Two of the larger additions to the framework have been the Autorun Rules Engine (ARE) and the Network Extension, the brain-children of @antisnatchor and @_bcoles. But BeEF isn't just about client-side testing, it's also a great tool if you need to quickly PoC JavaScript-based payloads.This session will cover the following:Hands on with the Autorun Rules Engine (clever scheduling and automation of multiple payloads)Network Extension (just how much local network can a browser see?)Having fun with CSRFSo you think HttpOnly & Secure flags really help?Attendees will hopefully have a better appreciation of how BeEF works, and how custom modules and extensions can be developed to meet any custom requirements you may have.

<details><summary><strong>Certbot</strong></summary>

🔗 **Link:** [Certbot](https://github.com/bmw)  
📝 **Description:** The majority of the world's Web traffic is still unencrypted and sent using the insecure HTTP. Despite SSL/TLS having existed for decades, it has seen limited adoption on modern webservers. This is largely due to the plethora of obstacles one must over come to enable HTTPS. The process of obtaining a certificate can be expensive and convoluted. Additionally, creating a secure TLS configuration is difficult, especially when it must be constantly updated in response to new attacks against the protocol and implementations of it.To attempt to solve this problem, EFF, Mozilla Cisco, Akamai, IdenTrust, and a team from the University of Michigan have created Let's Encrypt, a free and automated certificate authority. Since the project entered beta in October of last year, the CA has issued millions of certificates making it one of the largest certificate authorities in the world today.Earlier this year, EFF unveiled Certbot, a free and open source tool which can be used to set up HTTPS on a webserver in the matter of seconds. Certbot communicates to the Let's Encrypt CA through a protocol called ACME allowing for automated domain validation and certificate issuance. In this session, I plan to show how easy it is to use Certbot to enable HTTPS with certificates from Let's Encrypt as well as answer any questions you may have about the project.

🔗 **Link:** [Otaku](https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/28c73da6cbf5e76e137a9100ab45697f)  
📝 **Description:** We've developed a tool gathering attack vectors against web application such as XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc. First, We prepared a web server as a decoy based on a famous CMS, WordPress, and built Mod Secrity to collect all logs regarding to HTTP requests including POST body data. Generally speaking, a decoy web server needs web access to some degree as to attract users and attackers. We deployed a system named OTAKU-BOT which automatically collects and posts random information about Japanese ANIME and MANGA(cartoon) into the decoy web server. Very characteristic point of this system is that we can find whether Japanese ANIME is likely to be targeted or not by attackers. (or No correlation between them).Furthermore, We developed another web application "WP Portal", which visualizes these attacks in a real-time. This application enable us to monitor attack trend. WP Portal also has a vulnerability scanner for WordPress. You can start the scanner and view vulnerability reports on WP Portal.Dictionary Files for the scanner is created from honeypots and are updating daily. We will demonstrate this bot and the visualization tool. Participants can got attack vectors via WP Portal! Furthermore, our demo will show honeypots, a website, and analysis of attacks against WordPress.

📝 **Description:** Crypto Ransomware has become a popular attack vector used by malicious actors to quickly turn infections into profits. From a defensive perspective, the detection of new ransomware variants relies heavily on signatures, point solution posture and binary level indicators of compromise (IOC). This approach is inefficient at protecting targets against the rapid changes in tactics and delivery mechanisms typical of modern ransomware campaigns. We propose a novel approach for blending multiple signals (called micro behaviors) to detect ransomware with more flexibility than using IOC matching alone.The goal of the approach is to provide expressive mechanisms for detection via contextual indicators and micro behaviors that correlate to attacker tactics, even if they evolve with time. The presenters will provide open source code that will allow users and fellow researchers to replicate the use of these techniques. We will conclude with a focus on how to tie this approach to active defense measures and existing infrastructure.This tool will be applied to PCAPS and will then mine and display relationships of Micro Behaviors particular to ransomware traffic. Built with Spark notebook https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook we are leveraging Apache Spark (https://spark.apache.org/) for scalable data processing and MlLib for an anlalytics API (https://spark.apache.org/mllib/). The notebook will provide an interface for the ingestion of heterogenous data and the ability to build a combination of behavior based risk indictors combined with classic signatures. Prototype examples of different risk profiles will be demonstrated with the API via spark notebook but the libraries themselves should be usable in any Java backed code base.

🔗 **Link:** [AMIRA: Automated Malware Incident Response and Analysis](https://github.com/jjsendor)  
📝 **Description:** Even for a larger incident response team handling all of the repetitive tasks related to malware infections is a tedious task. Our malware analysts have spent a lot of time chasing digital forensics from potentially infected Mac OS X systems, leveraging open source tools, like OSXCollector. Early on, we have automated some part of the analysis process, augmenting the initial set of digital forensics collected from the machines with the information gathered from the threat intelligence APIs. They helped us with additional information on potentially suspicious domains, URLs and file hashes. But our approach to the analysis still required a certain degree of configuration and manual maintenance that was consuming lots of attention from malware responders.Enter automation: turning all of your repetitive tasks in a scripted way that will help you deal faster with the incident discovery, forensic collection and analysis, with fewer possibilities to make a mistake. We went ahead and turned OSXCollector toolkit into AMIRA: Automated Malware Incident Response and Analysis service. AMIRA turns the forensic information gathered by OSXCollector into actionable response plan, suggesting the infection source as well as suspicious files and domains requiring a closer look. Furthermore, we integrated AMIRA with our incident response platform, making sure that as little interaction as necessary is required from the analyst to follow the investigation. Thanks to that, the incident response team members can focus on what they excel at: finding unusual patterns and the novel ways that malware was trying to sneak into the corporate infrastructure.

🔗 **Link:** [DET](https://github.com/sensepost/DET)  
📝 **Description:** DET aims to provide a framework to assist with exfiltrating data using either one or several channels. Social media has become extremely popular in recent attacks such as HammerToss, campaign uncovered by FireEye in July 2015. Several tools are also publicly available allowing you to remotely access computers through "legitimate" services such as Gmail (GCat) or Twitter (Twittor). Often gaining access to a network is just the first step for a targeted attacker. Once inside, the goal is to go after sensitive information and exfiltrate it to servers under their control. To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected. With this in mind, I created the Data Exfiltration Toolkit (DET) to help both penetration testers testing deployed security devices and those admins who've installed and configured them, to ensure they are working as expected and detecting when sensitive data is leaving the network.

🔗 **Link:** [Elastic Handler](https://github.com/devgc/ElasticHandler/blob/master/scripts/ExternalDeviceExample.py)  
📝 **Description:** Elastic Handler is a DFIR specific replacement for the LogstashElastic Handler allows you to take all the tools you currently run and make their output better by doing the following:It allows you to define a mapping from the CSV/TSV/Etc output you are getting now into JSON so that ES can ingest itIt allows you to normalize all of the data you are feeding in so that your column names are suddenly the same allowing cross reporting searching and correlation.It lets you harness the extreme speed of Elastic Search to do the heavy listing in your correlationIt lets you take a unified view of your data/report to automate that analysis and create spreadsheets/etc. that you would have spent a day on previouslyThe idea here is to let computers do what can be automated so you can spend more time using what makes humans special. What I mean by that is your analyst brains and experience to spot patterns, trends and meaning from the output of the reports. In the GitHub repository there are several mappings provided for the tools, we call out most like; Tzworks tools, Shellbag explorer, our link parser, Mandiant's Shimcache parser, etc. But the cool thing about this framework is that to bring in another report, all you have to do is generate two text files to define your mapping, there is no code involved.

🔗 **Link:** [eXpose](https://github.com/joshsaxe/eXposeDeepNeuralNetwork)  
📝 **Description:** From hiding their tools in innocuous-looking file paths to creating registry keys that hide malicious commands to inviting users to visit deceptive URLs, attackers frequently use deception to penetrate and hide on our networks. Currently our community uses URL blacklists and rule-based detection mechanisms to detect such deception. The eXpose deep neural network, which we will be releasing as free software simultaneously with Blackhat USA 2016, goes beyond these simple methods to provide artificial intelligence driven detection of these objects, detecting upwards of 90% of previously unseen malicious URLs, malicious file paths, and malicious registry keys at low false positive rates.eXpose's approach is based on recent advances in deep learning research, and uses neural network primitives such as character-level embeddings, heterogenously-sized convolutional filters, dropout, and batch normalization to achieve a high detection rate. We compared eXpose to conventional machine learning methods and found that eXpose achieves a significant boost in detection accuracy. In our presentation we will explain how eXpose works, demonstrate how to use it both from the command line and as a Python module, demonstrate its ability to detect new malicious URLs, file paths, and registry keys, and challenge our audience to beat eXpose at guessing which previously-unseen objects are malicious or not.

🔗 **Link:** [FLOSS](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss/blob/master/pyproject.toml)  
📝 **Description:** The FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS) is an open source tool that automatically detects, extracts, and decodes obfuscated strings in Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Malware analysts, forensic investigators, and incident responders can use FLOSS to quickly extract sensitive strings to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs). Malware authors encode strings in their programs to hide malicious capabilities and impede reverse engineering. Even simple encoding schemes defeat the 'strings' tool and complicate static and dynamic analysis. FLOSS uses advanced static analysis techniques, such as emulation, to deobfuscate encoded strings.FLOSS is extremely easy to use and works against a large corpus of malware. It follows a similar invocation as the 'strings' tool. Users that understand how to interpret the strings found in a binary will understand FLOSS's output. FLOSS extracts higher value strings, as strings that are obfuscated typically contain the most sensitive configuration resources â including C2 server addresses, names of dynamically resolved imports, suspicious file paths, and other IOCs. I will describe the computer science that powers the tool, and why it works. I will also show how to use FLOSS and demonstrate the decoding of strings from a wide variety of malware families.

📝 **Description:** Focusing on Windows operating systems, we've developed an agent to try to activate some techniques that malware usually include to avoid being detected by a sandbox or malware analyst, emulating malware analysis computer inside a common PC. This agent would add a new layer of protection without interacting with the malware, because current malware will not run their malicious payload in a sandbox or while being debbuged. As we know the different malware families implement anti-reversing, anti-debuging and anti-virtualization characteristics along with other techniques such as to detect well known process and windows. Malware writers implement these techniques to prevent the execution of malicious code within a laboratory that could help researchers in their analysis and eradication.Some of those are:Detecting when a program is being debugged.Detecting when a program is running in a virtual machine, by reading some registry keys or locating some files or processes used by the virtualization technology.The detection programs used by malware analysts such as wireshark, IDA or process explorer.The proliferation of those techniques and strategies has brought us to a new solution; pretend the behavior of a malware analysis device and / or sandbox, by using some of the techniques explained above, in order to prevent the execution of the malicious code.

📝 **Description:** LOG-MD is designed for Windows based systems to audit log and advanced audit policy settings and guide users to enable and configure the audit settings based on industry audit standards like CIS, USGCB, AU ACSC and the 'Windows Logging Cheat Sheets' to help push and encourage moving security and detection of audit logging forward. LOG-MD was also designed to gather the artifacts from malicious activity, referred to as "Malicious Discovery", more easily than the standard methods many professionals use today. LOG-MD is designed to speed up the investigation of a suspect system, or help validate it is good, and to speed up evaluating malware in a lab environment.Malicious Discovery is a challenge for many and the Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) from a compromise or worse yet, a breach is still close to a year for most companies. LOG-MD is designed to help small, medium, large, and enterprise businesses improve their Malicious Discovery with a tool that can be run manually or distributed across the environment.LOG-MD replaces or augments several security and forensic tools that have not been updated in years, combing many features professionals rely on, into one easy to use tool. LOG-MD audits the system at each run for audit log related settings, and harvests security related log events. LOG-MD performs hashes of the full filesystem and compares it to a baseline or Master-Digest of trusted files to reduce files that need to be investigated. LOG-MD performs a full baseline of the registry and compares it to a trusted baseline, and searches for special artifacts like the null byte character used in registry keys to hide malware artifacts and large registry keys where malware hides. LOG-MD also harvests PowerShell activity and can harvest optional Sysmon and Windows Logging Service (WLS) events as well for more detailed analysis of system activity. LOG-MD utilizes whitelists to filter down the results of known good and trusted results to make Malicious Discovery easier and faster. In addition LOG-MD can take the artifact details of IP addresses and perform a WhoIs lookup to gain ownership and country information and run files and IP's through VirusTotal for artifact evaluation. Additionally, special artifacts hunting and reporting are being added to LOG-MD as malware authors create them, what we refer to as Malware Management, which is what LOG-MD is based on.

🔗 **Link:** [Maltese (Malware Traffic Emulating Software)](https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/28c73da6cbf5e76e137a9100ab45697f)  
📝 **Description:** In most cases, malware communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server in order to download updates or additional modules, receive commands, exfiltrate data, etc. The DNS system plays an important role in C&C communication: In order to hide their C&C servers from detection, common modern malware families employ Domain-Generation Algorithms (DGA) rather than hard-coded addresses to find their C&C servers. Furthermore, some malware families provide a back-channel and exfiltrate data in specially crafted DNS requests, thereby abusing the fact that DNS traffic is often not firewalled.Due to the importance of the DNS in malware's C&C communication, recent malware detection systems try to detect malware based on anomalies in DNS request patterns. As one would expect, the suppliers of such detection systems claim that their solutions work as a catch-all for any malware that abuses the DNS system as part of its operation. But, prior to deploying any malware detector, one needs to test these claims by evaluating the effectiveness of the detector. Also, when a new malware variant is detected in the wild, it is important for security teams to verify that their deployed solutions can detect them.One way of accomplishing the above tasks is to execute real malware samples and observe the results of the detector. However, this is infeasible in a production network, as there is always a risk of the malware causing damage. Furthermore, malware samples often do not execute on demand, and therefore testing may be difficult. In our contribution, we describe a tool and a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of DNS-based malware detectors using emulation. We propose the following approach: We emulate the DNS traffic patterns of a given malware family, inject it into a network, and observe whether the malware detector reports an infection. The injected traffic is completely benign and, therefore, testing poses no risk to the network. The generation of DNS traffic patterns is based on information published by various members of the security community. From malware analysis, typically, one or more of the following artifacts may be found for a given malware â a list of domains generated, a network packet capture (PCAP) of the malicious traffic, or a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) that is published by another researcher.Our tool enables security professionals to utilize any of these three artifacts in an easy, quick, and configurable manner for generating DNS traffic patterns. The tool is implemented in Python and will be made available free of charge, and we are also exploring an open source license. Our presentation will demo an evaluation infrastructure, and discuss use cases in order to help the audience gain more confidence in their security deployments. The tool is built using a plugin-based architecture, and we will also discuss ways in which the audience may contribute new plugins to the tool.

📝 **Description:** A typical approach towards investigating intrusion incidents is to collect files that might have been dropped from a compromised server. These files could be extracted from network traffic or if we are lucky they could be obtained from the compromised system itself. An analyst can then use her expertise to re-create the attack scenario and understand possible vectors. Depending on her skills, this process might prove easy or extremely difficult. Our aim is to provide a framework that provides a common ground for forensic analysis of network traffic and dropped files using intuitive visualization of structural properties of network traffic and data files, combined with the proven methods of behavioral heuristics.This talk aims to help users understand how to visually classify streaming data such as a network traffic buffer for an active TCP connection or chunked data read from a file on disk. Both these objects under analysis could be considered a binary blobs which could be rendered as an image highlighting the binary structure embedded within them. When this approach is combined with statistical file-format independent properties (like the theoretical minsize, compression ratio, entropy, etc.) and certain file-format specific properties (like the Yara rules matching on parsed HTTP payload or heuristics rules matching on the sections of a PE file), it provides a completely new perspective into the analysis process.Additionally, we want to emphasize on the fact that the most important aspect of analysis process is to quickly correlate attributes and identify patterns. The approach we propose is to minimize the noise and highlight significant behavior using heuristics targeted specifically towards structural pattern identification. The visual representation of the input file provides a concise overview of file's data patterns and the way they are combined together. One glimpse of this visual representation is enough to quickly classify a file as suspicious.In this talk, we will focus on presenting a framework that can help users with forensic analysis of intrusion artifacts using a novel visual analysis approach. This framework could be used to create standalone utilities or to enhance in-house analysis tools via the native API. For quick analysis, users could consume the framework output directly through the packaged commandline tool or via an external log analytic tool like Splunk.

🔗 **Link:** [Burp Extension for Non-HTTP Traffic](https://github.com/voidism/Input_Method_auto-Modifier/blob/master/EnWordBase.json)  
📝 **Description:** The Burp Non-HTTP proxy is specifically designed to help in testing thick client and mobile applications. It adds to BurpSuite a DNS server to help test applications that are difficult to route through proxies and adds interceptors to manipulate/mangle binary and non-HTTP protocols.The tool stores traffic in a sqlite database that can be exported or imported to save and analyze later. It can intercept and modify traffic automatically based on rules you assign or it can be modified manually as the traffic hits the proxy server. The tool also support SSL/TLS and signs certificates based on Burps CA certificate. If your testing on a mobile device that already has Burp's CA cert then the traffic will be seamlessly decrypted without errors into the tool for you to mangle before sending it on to the outgoing server.This tool arouse out of the need to test applications that were switching to more realtime protocols in both mobile applications and some web based Silverlight applications I had been testing. I wrote this tool as an easy extension to add to burp that would also be platform/OS independent vs some other tools out there that did similar functions.

🔗 **Link:** [Droid-FF: Android Fuzzing Framework](https://github.com/antojoseph/droid-ff)  
📝 **Description:** Droid-FF is the very first Android fuzzing framework which helps researchers find memory corruption bugs written in c /c ++ â It comes as a VM which is ready to go and easy to work with. Why Droid-FF ? Native code is preferred over JIT languages due to their memory efficiency and speed, but security bugs within native code can result in exploits that can take over the Android system . The goal of the fuzzer is help researchers find security bugs by fuzzing Android.What does it do?Data Generation Currently includes Peach, with some pre-populated pit files, which helps in generating data be it "dex,ttf,png,avi,mp4" etcApproaches a . Dumb fuzzing: From a large input section of valid data , the fuzzer generates new data with mutations in place. b. Intelligent Fuzzing: We create a file format representation of the target data and let the fuzzer generate data which is structurally valid, but has invalid data in sections.Fuzzing System The fuzzing system is an automated program which runs the dataset against the target program and deals with any error conditions that can possibly happen. It also maintains state so that we could resume the fuzzing from the right place in an event of a crash.Advanced Triage System In the event of a valid crash, the triage system collects the tombstone files which contains the dump of the registers and system state with detailed information. It also collects valid logs and the file responsible for the crash and moves it to the triage database. The triage database runs scripts on the data derived from crashes, like the type pf the crash, for eg : SIGSEGV, the PC address at this crash and checks for any duplicate, if found, the duplicate entry is removed and is moved to crashes for investigation.What we're using during this lab? The android system which we are going to fuzz is an Engineering build from AOSP which has symbols, thus in an event of a crash, it will be much easier to triage the crash. The system supports fuzzing real devices, emulators , and images running on virtual box. How Efficient is this Framework? We ran the fuzzer in Intelligent fuzzing mode with mp4 structure fed in for 14 hours on the stagefright binary and it was able to reproduce 3 crashes which were exploitable ( CVE's) and lots of un-interesting crashes mostly dude to out of memory, duplicates or null pointers.Goals of the FrameworkMake Fuzzing Easy and available for allCompletely open source and extensibleMake android eco-system more secure

📝 **Description:** Do you feel the needâ¦ the need for speed? Then check out our brand new penetration testing drone. This Raspberry Pi based copter is both cheap and easy to create on your own, making it the first practical drone solution for your pentesting needs. Drones have emerged as the prevailing weapon of choice in modern warfare, so it's only logical that we'd also explore the potential applications of this formidable tool in cyber warfare. While there have been presentations before on weaponizing drones for the purposes of pentesting, these efforts were not easily replicated by anyone other than experienced drone aficionados with several thousands of dollars to spend â ultimately resulting in somewhat clunky, partial solutions. Conditions have finally matured enough to where pentesters who are inexperienced with drones can get up and running fairly quickly and spending only a couple hundred dollars on a Raspberry Pi based drone copter solution. Our talk will be aimed at this target audience, helping equip pentesters with drone tools of the future.In this talk, we'll demonstrate how this drone can be used to perform aerial recon, attack wireless infrastructure and clients, land on a target facility roof, and serve as a persistent backdoor. In fact, we'll show you how to attack 'over the air' protocols such as RFID, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and more. We'll even demo a special edition "RickMote Danger Drone" that you can use to patrol your neighborhood and rickroll Google Chromecast-connected TVs.Additionally, we will showcase the best-of-breed in hardware and software that you'll need. This will include the release of our custom Raspberry Pi SD card image, parts list, 3D print objects, and necessary instructions for you to create a Danger Drone of your own. We'll also be giving away a fully functional Danger Drone to one lucky audience member - guaranteed to leave your friends feeling peanut butter and jealous!

📝 **Description:** What if the only requirements for taking down a corporate network are a bit of smooth talking, 60 minutes and $35? Traditional hacking techniques and corporate espionage have evolved. Advanced attacks nowadays include a combination of social engineering, physical security penetration and logical security hacking. It is our job as security professionals to think outside the box and think about the different ways that hackers might use to infiltrate corporate networks. The WarBerryPi is a customized RaspBerryPi hacking dropbox which is used in Red Teaming engagements with the sole purpose of performing reconnaissance and mapping of an internal network and providing access to the remote hacking team.The outcome of these red teaming exercises is the demonstration that if a low cost microcomputer loaded with python code can bypass security access controls and enumerate and gather such a significant amount of information about the infrastructure network which is located at; then what dedicated hackers with a large capital can do is beyond conception.

BLE-replay is a Python tool for recording, modifying, replaying, and fuzzing writes to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripherals. It can be used for testing or reversing application layer interactions between a mobile application and a BLE peripheral. This tool is useful if an application writes some characteristics on the BLE device in order to configure/unlock/disable some feature. You want to quickly capture the relevant information from a packet log into a human-readable format and mess around with it from a laptop. It is the first tool built upon our new BLESuite library.BLESuite is a Python library that enables application layer communication between a host machine and a BLE device. The library greatly simplifies the scripting of BLE activity. It provides a simple connection manager and supports scanning advertisements, service discovery, smart scanning of all services/characteristics/descriptors, and sync/async read/write. We will also demonstrate the BLESuiteCLI, which provides quick access to all of these features from the command line.

📝 **Description:** What if the only requirements for taking down a corporate network are a bit of smooth talking, 60 minutes and $35? Traditional hacking techniques and corporate espionage have evolved. Advanced attacks nowadays include a combination of social engineering, physical security penetration and logical security hacking. It is our job as security professionals to think outside the box and think about the different ways that hackers might use to infiltrate corporate networks. The WarBerryPi is a customized RaspBerryPi hacking dropbox which is used in Red Teaming engagements with the sole purpose of performing reconnaissance and mapping of an internal network and providing access to the remote hacking team.The outcome of these red teaming exercises is the demonstration that if a low cost microcomputer loaded with python code can bypass security access controls and enumerate and gather such a significant amount of information about the infrastructure network which is located at; then what dedicated hackers with a large capital can do is beyond conception.

🔗 **Link:** [Arsenal Theater Demo: Faraday](https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/28c73da6cbf5e76e137a9100ab45697f)  
📝 **Description:** Since collaborative pentesting is more common each day and teams become larger, sharing the information between pentesters can become a difficult task. Different tools, different formats, long outputs (in the case of having to audit a large network) can make it almost impossible. You may end up with wasted efforts, duplicated tasks, a lot of text files scrambled in your working directory. And then, you need to collect that same information from your teammates and write a report for your client, trying to be as clear as possible.The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during the pentest, without changing the way you work. You run a command, or import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share that with the rest of the team in real time. Faraday has more than 50 plugins available (and counting), including a lot of common tools. And if you use a tool for which Faraday doesn't have a plugin, you can create your own. During this presentation we're going release Faraday v2.0.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months.

📝 **Description:** autoDANE: Automatic Domain Admin & Network ExploitationautoDANE is a tool to automate the process of mapping and compromising internal networks. It is available at https://github.com/sensepost/autoDANE Given the prevalence of Microsoft Active Directory domains as the primary means of managing large corporate networks globally; one of the first goals of any internal penetration test is to get Domain Administrator (DA) level access. In demonstration of how common a goal and practise this is, a plethora of tools and techniques exists to assist with this process, from the initial "in" through to to elevation of privilege and eventually extracting and cracking all domain credentials.However, the overall process followed is still manual and time consuming. Even where tools exist, the orchestration from one to the next is manual. The time required both detracts from potentially more dangerous attacks that may be specific to the organisation under assessment, as well as limits those who know of their organisation's vulnerabilities to those with offensive security skills or willing to pay for an assessment. Observing this, we decided to construct a framework for automating such activities. This framework orchestrates the industries currently favoured tools to get DA on internal networks.The goal for the project is to get Domain Admin rights as quickly as possible, so that analysts can start an internal assessment as a privileged user, rather than finishing as one. This will allow analysts to spend time on engagements emulating real life hacking scenarios, such as going after business critical applications, while still comprehensively assessing the internal network. Combining the software vulnerabilities, as well as a realistic idea of how people with malicious or criminal intent might reach them, will provide organisations the information they need to actually improve their defensive posture.For Arsenal, several updates have been made and will be released:Detailed scope definition and proportionality limitsSupport for adding hosts/ranges during runtimeDomain pivot tables-a list of which credentials worked where and which users are in which groupsDetailed filtering and full-text searching across tool-run logsOne click RDP to hosts with confirmed credentialsSQL Server discoveryBasic password cracking when hashes are pulled

📝 **Description:** Nearly every penetration test begins the same way; run a NMAP scan, review the results, choose interesting services to enumerate and attack, and perform post-exploitation activities. What was once a fairly time consuming manual process, is now automated!Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit (APT2) is an extendable modular framework designed to automate common tasks performed during penetration testing. APT2 can chain data gathered from different modules together to build dynamic attack paths. Starting with a NMAP scan of the target environment, discovered ports and services become triggers for the various modules which in turn can fire additional triggers. Have FTP, Telnet, or SSH? APT2 will attempt common authentication. Have SMB? APT2 determines what OS and looks for shares and other information. Modules include everything from enumeration, scanning, brute forcing, and even integration with Metasploit. Come check out how APT2 will save you time on every engagement.

🔗 **Link:** [BloodHound](https://github.com/ly4k/BloodHound)  
📝 **Description:** Active Directory domain privilege escalation is a critical component of most penetration tests and red team assessments, but standard methodology dictates a manual and often tedious process â gather credentials, analyze new systems we now have admin rights on, pivot, and repeat until we reach our objective. Then -- and only then -- we can look back and see the path we took in its entirety. But that may not be the only, nor shortest path we could have taken.By combining the concept of derivative admin (the chaining or linking of administrative rights), existing tools, and graph theory, we have developed a capability called BloodHound, which can reveal the hidden and unintended relationships in Active Directory domains. BloodHound is operationally-focused, providing an easy-to-use web interface and PowerShell ingestor for memory-resident data collection and offline analysis.BloodHound offers several advantages to both attackers and defenders. Otherwise invisible, high-level organizational relationships are exposed. Most possible escalation paths can be efficiently and swiftly identified. Simplified data aggregation accelerates blue and red team analysis. BloodHound has the power and the potential to dramatically change the way you think about and approach Active Directory domain security.

📝 **Description:** CodexGigas is a malware profiling search engine that allows malware hunters and analysts to really interrogate the internals of malware and perform searches over a large number of file characteristics. For instance, instead of relying on file-level hashes, we can compute other features such as imported functions, strings, constants, file segments, code regions, or anything that is defined in the file type specification, and that provides us with more than 142 possible searchable patterns, that can be combined.Similar to human fingerprints, every malware has its own unique digital fingerprint that differentiates it from others. As a result, malware will always attempt to hide its true self by deleting or changing this information to avoid detection by antivirus companies and malware researchers.Since malware developers go to great lengths to obfuscate their characteristics, it is often difficult for by researchers and malware analysts to identify multiple characteristics and correlation points. By analyzing malware internals, the algorithm is able to build characteristic families to which a new sample can be categorized and therefore identified for specific behavior, enabling early detection of new malware by comparing against existing malware. CodexGigas engine, framework, analysis plugins, and the web portal, will be released as open source at Black Hat.Come to see how CodexGigas could be used to enhance your malware hunting.

🔗 **Link:** [Ebowla](https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla/blob/master/LICENSE.md)  
📝 **Description:** Dropping a payload or malware onto a target is usually not an issue given the variety of vulnerable software in use. Your challenge is keeping the payload from working and spreading to unintended targets, eventually leading to reverse engineers, crowdsourced or professional, who pick apart your work, and start an industry to stop your success. Inspiration for the tool came from the effective use of environmental keying in Gauss malware (2012) that, to this day, has prevented the reverse engineering community around the world from determining the purpose and use of all operational modules used in various industry attacks [https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-the-encrypted-gauss-payload-5/].Our framework, Ebowla [https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla], implements techniques above and beyond those found in Gauss or Flashback to keep your payload from detection and analysis. Currently we support three protection mechanisms: AES file based keying, AES environmental based keying, and One Time Pad (closer to a digital book cipher) based off a known file on the target's system. The protected payloads are generated with either a stand-alone python or golang in-memory loader for the target system.

🔗 **Link:** [NetNeedle](https://github.com/optiv/netneedle/blob/master/cmdquit.c)  
📝 **Description:** We believe that hiding a needle in a haystack is easier if the needle looks like hay. NetNeedle provides encrypted control channels and chat sessions that are disguised to look like other common network activity. It only transmits "decoy" data in the  "payload " section of any packet, so forensic analysts will only see packets that look identical to ordinary ping or HTTP GET requests. The actual data is encoded in IP headers in fields that typically contain random values. This tool was originally written to demonstrate network based steganography principals. However, it is usable in real world circumstances, and can assist in penetration testing within restricted network environments.In addition to evasion features, penetration testers can use NetNeedle to maintain control over servers in environments with highly restrictive access lists. Because this tool subverts expectations surrounding network traffic, it enables users to set up back doors that use simple ICMP packets or TCP ports that are already in use. Administrators who believe that their systems are safe due to access control lists based on a "principle of least privilege" or who believe that ICMP ping is harmless will find themselves sadly mistaken.

🔗 **Link:** [DataSploit](https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/28c73da6cbf5e76e137a9100ab45697f)  
📝 **Description:** Overview:Performs automated OSINT on a domain / email / username / phone and find out relevant information from different sources.Useful for Pen-testers, Cyber Investigators, Product companies, defensive security professionals, etc.Correlates and collaborate the results, show them in a consolidated manner.Tries to find out credentials, api-keys, tokens, subdomains, domain history, legacy portals, etc. related to the target.Available as single consolidating tool as well as standalone scripts.Available in both GUI and Console."Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay". This quote by fictional detective Sherlock Holmes certainly suits every InfoSec professional's daily struggle. Irrespective of whether you are attacking a target or defending one, you need to have a clear picture of the threat landscape before you get in. This is where DataSploit comes into the picture. Utilizing various Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools and techniques that we have found to be effective, DataSploit brings them all into one place, correlates the raw data captured and gives the user, all the relevant information about the domain / email / phone number / person, etc. It allows you to collect relevant information about a target which can expand your attack/defence surface very quickly. Sometimes it might even pluck the low hanging fruits for you without even touching the target and give you quick wins. Of course, a user can pick a single small job (which do not correlates obviously), or can pick up the parent search which will launch a bunch of queries, call other required scripts recursively, correlate the data and give you all juicy information in one go.Created using our beloved Python, MongoDb and Django, DataSploit simply requires the bare minimum data (such as domain name, email ID, person name, etc.) before it goes out on a mining spree. Once the data is collected, firstly the noise is removed, after which data is correlated and after multiple iterations it is stored locally in a database which could be easily visualised on the UI provided. The sources that have been integrated are all hand picked and are known to be providing reliable information. We have used them previously during different offensive as well as defensive engagements and found them helpful.Worried about setup? Well, there are two major requirements here:1. Setting up the db, django, libraries, etc. We have got a script which will automate this for you, so can just go ahead and shoot the OSINT job.2. Feeding specific API keys for few specific sources. We are going to have a knowledge base where step by step instructions to generate these API keys will be documented. Sweet deal?Apart from this, in order to make it more useful in daily life of a pen-tester, we are working to make the tool as an extension of the other tools that pen-testers commonly use such as Burp Suite, Maltego etc. so that you can feel at home during the usage.

📝 **Description:** Do you feel the needâ¦ the need for speed? Then check out our brand new penetration testing drone. This Raspberry Pi based copter is both cheap and easy to create on your own, making it the first practical drone solution for your pentesting needs. Drones have emerged as the prevailing weapon of choice in modern warfare, so it's only logical that we'd also explore the potential applications of this formidable tool in cyber warfare. While there have been presentations before on weaponizing drones for the purposes of pentesting, these efforts were not easily replicated by anyone other than experienced drone aficionados with several thousands of dollars to spend â ultimately resulting in somewhat clunky, partial solutions. Conditions have finally matured enough to where pentesters who are inexperienced with drones can get up and running fairly quickly and spending only a couple hundred dollars on a Raspberry Pi based drone copter solution. Our talk will be aimed at this target audience, helping equip pentesters with drone tools of the future.In this talk, we'll demonstrate how this drone can be used to perform aerial recon, attack wireless infrastructure and clients, land on a target facility roof, and serve as a persistent backdoor. In fact, we'll show you how to attack 'over the air' protocols such as RFID, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and more. We'll even demo a special edition "RickMote Danger Drone" that you can use to patrol your neighborhood and rickroll Google Chromecast-connected TVs.Additionally, we will showcase the best-of-breed in hardware and software that you'll need. This will include the release of our custom Raspberry Pi SD card image, parts list, 3D print objects, and necessary instructions for you to create a Danger Drone of your own. We'll also be giving away a fully functional Danger Drone to one lucky audience member - guaranteed to leave your friends feeling peanut butter and jealous! This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of drone and physical penetration testing fields. Someone better call Kenny Loggins, because you're in the Danger Drone.â¦No, no boys, there's two 'O's in Bishop Fox.

🔗 **Link:** [Faraday](https://github.com/fedek)  
📝 **Description:** Since collaborative pentesting is more common each day and teams become larger, sharing the information between pentesters can become a difficult task. Different tools, different formats, long outputs (in the case of having to audit a large network) can make it almost impossible. You may end up with wasted efforts, duplicated tasks, a lot of text files scrambled in your working directory. And then, you need to collect that same information from your teammates and write a report for your client, trying to be as clear as possible.The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during the pentest, without changing the way you work. You run a command, or import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share that with the rest of the team in real time. Faraday has more than 50 plugins available (and counting), including a lot of common tools. And if you use a tool for which Faraday doesn't have a plugin, you can create your own. During this presentation we're going release Faraday v2.0.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months.

📝 **Description:** Scout2 is an open source tool that helps when assessing the security posture of AWS environments. This tool uses the AWS API to fetch configuration data for various Amazon services, including IAM, EC2, S3, RDS and CloudTrail. The gathered configuration is analyzed for known configuration weaknesses, then made available via an offline HTML report. The report provides security-oriented views of the AWS resources that were analyzed, as well as a list of security risks that were identified.Since its initial launch over two years ago, Scout2 doubled the number of services in scope and built-in security checks. If you worry that access to your AWS account -- and the resources it holds -- may not be secure enough, stop by and learn how you can easily identify security gaps. The presenter will demo multiple use cases, including use and comparison of various rulesets, customization of a ruleset, and creation of a new rule.
