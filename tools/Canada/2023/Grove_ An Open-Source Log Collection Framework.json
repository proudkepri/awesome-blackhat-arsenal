  "Description": "Grove is a log collection framework designed to support a unified way of collecting, storing, and routing logs from Software as a Service (SaaS) providers which do not natively support log streaming.\n\n\nThis is performed by periodically collecting logs from configured sources, and writing them to arbitrary destinations.\n\n\nGrove enables teams to collect security related events from their vendors in a reliable and consistent way, while allowing this data to be stored and analyzed with existing tools.",
