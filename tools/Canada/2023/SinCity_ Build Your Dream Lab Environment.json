  "Description": "Security practitioners are still wasting time today building and maintaining lab environments through \"manual\" and cumbersome processes. In doing so, they are missing out on the potential DevOps methodologies and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices offer. This daunting work must end now.\n\n\nThis arsenal demonstration will introduce SinCity, a GPT-powered, MITRE ATT&CK-based tool which automates the provisioning and management of an IT environment in a conversational way. SinCity reduces the efforts needed to build a full-blown lab environment from months to minutes by providing an abstraction layer for customizing network topologies, crafting attack scenarios, and tuning security controls.\n\n\nAttendees who frequently sandbox malware, analyze TTPs, or evaluate detection capabilities - this arsenal will save you precious time.",
